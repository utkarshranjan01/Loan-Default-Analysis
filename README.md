# Loan Default Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project develops machine learning models to predict loan defaults based on borrower characteristics and loan features. The analysis aims to help financial institutions better assess credit risk and make informed lending decisions.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions face significant risks from loan defaults. The challenge is to accurately predict the likelihood of default using borrower information and loan characteristics. This project develops machine learning models to:
- Identify high-risk borrowers
- Understand key default risk factors
- Optimize loan approval processes
- Reduce default-related losses

## Dataset Features

### Borrower Information
- Age
- Income
- Employment Type
- Education Level
- Marital Status

### Loan Characteristics
- Loan Amount
- DTI Ratio
- Credit Score
- Number of Credit Lines
- Loan Purpose

## Model Performance Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 88% | 86% | 87% | 86% |
| Random Forest | 97% | 96% | 97% | 96% |
| XGBoost | 92% | 91% | 92% | 91% |

## Key Findings

### Risk Factors
1. **DTI Ratio**: Strongest predictor of default risk
2. **Employment Status**: Full-time employees show lowest default rates
3. **Education Level**: Higher education correlates with lower defaults
4. **Age**: Moderate correlation with default probability
5. **Loan Amount**: Larger loans show higher default risk

### Model Selection
- **Production**: XGBoost (best balance of accuracy and efficiency)
- **Regulatory**: Logistic Regression (best interpretability)
- **Maximum Accuracy**: Random Forest (highest overall performance)
